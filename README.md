# Introduction

We develop a simple decentralised microfinance dApp with no-collateral.

# PROBLEM

Microfinance is a banking service provided to unemployed or low-income individuals. People want to build a platform that provides microfinance loans. However, they have to face two main issues:
Expensive traditional audit fee (The amount of loan is small, not worth it for traditional audit).
Truthless intermediary.

# GOAL

The objective is to create a lending and borrowing platform without any third-party interference and with no-collateral deposit required to borrow the loan. It will be a peer-to-peer platform which will have a small gas fee and all the transaction will store in an immutable database.
